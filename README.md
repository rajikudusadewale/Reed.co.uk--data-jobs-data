Python


Here's the complete Python code that was used to extract the job data from the HTML content above, put it into a table, and then save it as a CSV file.
Please replace '/path/to/your/html/file.html' with the actual path to your HTML file. The above script will read the HTML content, parse it to find the job card elements, 
extract the relevant job data, and finally save the data to a CSV file at the specified path.

Note that in an actual script, you would need to handle exceptions and edge cases, such as missing data or unexpected HTML structures. 
This script assumes that the HTML structure is consistent with the examples you've provided.

Once you have the path set correctly, you can run this script in a Python environment that has BeautifulSoup and pandas installed.
